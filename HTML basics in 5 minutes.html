            <h1>Basics of HTML in 5 minutes</h1>
            <h2>General HTML</h2>
            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>
                HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard language for developing internet pages.
                Most likely, every webpage you've ever visited has been made in HTML. All common browsers
                (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera) all clearly present HTML.
                In this document, you will learn HTML5.
            </p>
            <h3>Why should I learn it?</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, HTML is the standard language for coding websites. Even if you plan a
                career not into web development, learning this will help you out a lot.
            </p>
            <h3>Important Notices:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This course does not go in depth about CSS and Javascript.</li>
                <li>
                    To learn programming, you need to put effort. If you don't want to do programming in your future,
                    then don't learn coding.
                </li>
                <li>HTML is one of the easiest (if not THE easiest) coding language to learn.</li>
                <li>
                    To help you learn, this course will ask you to create your own files. Please note that,
                    while not taking too much space, learning HTML will take up some space (not much, don't worry!).

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                Before you go coding, you need materials. This includes a text editor
                (which edits text, surprise), a file (to store the code somewhere),
                and basic computer skills (copy and paste, basics of how a computer works,
                software requirements). Scroll down to see your requirements.
                <br>
                Text Editors:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, now that you know that, now its time for the fun:
            </p>
            <b>
                In your computer, open a new text file and rename it something simple like "firstproject.html".
                It doesn't matter what the name of the file is, but the file must end with .html.
                <br>
                Open it with your text editor.
            </b>
            <p>Now type the following:</p>
            <hr>
            <code>
                <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</p>
                <p>&lt;head&gt;</p>
                <p>&lt;title&gt; My first title! &lt;/title&gt;</p>
                <p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>
                <p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
                <p>&lt;p&gt; This is my first HTML sentence! Woo hoo! &lt;/p&gt;</p>
                <p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
            </code>
            <hr>
            <p>Now, save it manually or the recommended way (ctrl + s), and open it up on your browser!</p>
            <p>Congrats! You made a <b>sentence</b>.</p>
            <p>
                Let's analyse it. Hopefully, the first thing you noticed is this:
                <br>
                <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                <BR>
                This is called a tag. It contains a < symbol, a few letters, and a > symbol.
                <br>
                What does this do? It tells whatever is inside of it (whatever is in the &lt; and &gt;)
                to function in a specific way. Another thing you should notice is that it is surrounded
                by TWO tags. This will limit what is inside or outside the tag!
                <br>
                You will also notice that the ending tag has a "/". Why? This will tell the code
                that it will end <b>there</b>.
                <br>
                The tag is the most important function in HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, delete everything and just type in  the following and refresh (or reopen) your file.
                <br>
                <code>This is my second HTML sentence! Yee haw!</code>
                <br>
                Why do does this sentence appear even though it has no tag to tell it
                to appear?
                <br>
                <br>
                That is because HTML is a very forgiving language.
                <br>
                This is the main reason why HTML is a great language for beginners-
                one tiny mistake won't break the whole picture. 
                <br>
                You will learn about this in depth in later chapters.
            </p>
            <p>Now, let's experiment with more tags.</p>
            <p>In your code, try the following: &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;h7&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;.</p>
            <p>You should get the following results:</p>
            <h1>Hello world.</h1>
            <h2>Hello world.</h2>
            <h3>Hello world.</h3>
            <h4>Hello world.</h4>
            <h5>Hello world.</h5>
            <h6>Hello world.</h6>
            <h7>Hello world.</h7>
            <br>
            <b>Hello world.</b>
            <br>
            <i>Hello world.</i>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hey, how come &lt;h7&gt; doesn't work? That's because that tag doesn't exist.
                In the &lt;h&gt; family, the tags only range from 1~6. All tags that don't work
                (or don't exist) will have the &lt;p&gt; tag by default.
                <br>
                If you have visual studio code, you'll notice it autocompletes just about everything.
                <br>
                Experiment with these and many other tags.
                Some tags, you'll notice, won't end with an ending tag, like &lt;br&gt; or &lt;hr&gt;.
                That is because they don't accept text "inside" of them.
            </p>
            <p>The &lt;br&gt; tag adds a space in the next row of a web page from the tag before it.</p>
            <hr>
            <b>For example, this is bold text.</b>
            <br>
            <i>Now this is italic text, one gap below the bold text.</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            <del>And now this is deleted text, 2 gaps below the italic text.</del>
            <hr>
            <p>The &lt;hr&gt; tag creates perfectly horizontal lines, like this.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>That was one line. You can make many.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <p>These lines can be manipulated to be big or small, wide or thin, of any colour. Look below.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr style="color:blue">
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr style="width:200px">
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr style="height: 100px;">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Here, I used the inline styling of <b>color:blue;</b>, <b>width:200px;</b>, and <b>height:100px;</b>, in respective order.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
